# Age and Gender Prediction using Digital Image Processing

## Overview

This project aims to predict the age and gender of individuals from facial images using digital image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The project consists of several components, including model training, image processing, and inference.

## Repository Structure

- **Model Trained:** This folder contains the trained models for age and gender prediction along with the python file and ipnyb file.
- **age and gender prediction image code:** Contains code for predicting age and gender from static images one model is without caffe and other model is with caffe.The predictions were done using caffe model so firstly please install caffe model wieghts and the protxt files as given in packages_needed read me file
- **age and gender prediction video code:** Contains code for predicting age and gender from video streams.total 3 models were used for this,1)original caffe 2)Orginal Caffe+clahe 3)trained model
- **packages_needed:** Contains a list of required packages and dependencies for running the project.
- **utk_full_dataset:** Dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Usage

1. **Training the Models:** Trained models for age and gender prediction are available in the `Model Trained` folder. 

2. **Predicting from Images:** Use the code provided in the `age and gender prediction image code` folder to predict age and gender from static images.

3. **Predicting from Videos:** Use the code provided in the `age and gender prediction video code` folder to predict age and gender from video streams.



## Dependencies

Ensure you have all the required packages listed in the `packages_needed` file installed in your environment before running the code.

## Dataset

The `utk_full_dataset` folder contains the dataset used for training and testing all the models including caffe and our trained model.
